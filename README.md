# sentiment-analysis
This project performs sentiment analysis on Twitter (now X) data to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze public tweets on specified topics, providing insights into public opinion trends.
Key goals:

Collect real-time or historical Twitter data using the Twitter API.
Preprocess text data (e.g., remove URLs, handle emojis, tokenize).
Apply machine learning models (e.g., VADER, TextBlob, or BERT-based classifiers) for sentiment scoring.
Visualize results with charts (e.g., pie charts for sentiment distribution, word clouds for common terms).

This is ideal for social media monitoring, brand sentiment tracking, or academic research.
Features

Data Collection: Fetch tweets via Twitter API v2 with filters for keywords, hashtags, or users.
Preprocessing Pipeline: Handles cleaning, lemmatization, and stop-word removal using NLTK/spaCy.
